					<p>
						I first fell in love with programming sophomore 
						year of high school when a friend invited me to work 
						on a video game with a group of students after classes.
						 I took computer science every year after that in high 
						 school until I came to RIT where I began by studying 
						 Human Centered Computing before switching into Web & Mobile 
						 Computing and finally becoming a double major between both. 
						 Currently I work as a TA during the school year whenever it 
						 doesn't get in the way of my classes.
						</p>
						 <p>
						In the summer of 2018, I started working as 
						an Android developer for PatientKeeper in Waltham, MA. My experience
						working for them was been amazing, but when school started in the fall, 
						I was only able to work part-time as a contractor for them.
						Last summer, I went to San Francisco to take on a software engineering
						internship with Uber working on their <a href="https://github.com/fusionjs/fusionjs">
						open source JavaScript framework FusionJS.</a>
						There, I was able to <a href = "https://github.com/fusionjs/fusionjs/pull/615"> 
							improve the runtime performance of many Fusion's cli commands.</a>
